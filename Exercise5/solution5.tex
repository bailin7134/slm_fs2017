	\subsection{Question 2-3}
	Parameter "MYCT" and "CGMIN" have very little contribution on the model we build.
	\subsection{Question 2-4}
	The method is:\\
	1. get the adjusted R square for each parameter\\
	2. choose the parameter with biggest adjusted R square to build the model\\
	3. add one of the not used parameters to the model and check the adjusted R square of
	new model, if none of them is greater than the reference model, then stop. Otherwise, 
	choose current model as reference model\\
	3. re-run step 2 until it stops.
	\subsection{Question 2-5}
	$Pr(>|t|)$ demonstrates how strong each parameter has influence on the final model\\
	Multiple R-squared shows how good the model is to predict the performance
