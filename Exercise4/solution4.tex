	conclusion:\\
	the wage is a linear function of eduction for both male and female.\\
	the linear model for male is: wage = education * 398.5 + 24\\
	the linear model for female is:	wage = eduction * 397.5 - 563.5\\

	Vendor name and model names have no relation to the system performance, therefore both of them are not able to be the predictive values.\\

	From the Summary Statistics, MMAX has the maximum PRP Correlation value. Therefore, MMAX is the variable which is chosen.\\

	\section{Solution to question 5}
	Among all the variables, $name$ and $origin$ are not able to used to explain $mpg$, since they contribute nothing to the $mpg$.\\
	The rest ones, like $cylinders$, $displacement$, $horsepower$, $weight$, $acceleration$ and $year$ have relation to the $mpg$.\\

	To choose the variable, linear model between $mpg$ and all other variables are built.

	\\
	$weight$ has the largest value in both multiply R-squared and F-statistic. So $weight$ is the one can be chosen to explain $mpg$.\\
